Search Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios The Senate\\'s bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and President Biden\\'s $3.5 trillion spending package could live or die this week — and take Democrats\\' fortunes with them. But all the minute-by-minute political drama obscures how much America could change if even a fraction of it passes. The big picture: Anything short of total failure could have a transformative impact on day-to-day life — from how we move around to our access to the internet, paid family leave and child care, health care and college. Here\\'s how your life could change if even some of the measures get to Biden\\'s desk. Transportation: More people would be driving electric cars, and lower-income people would have better access to public transit, Axios\\' Joann Muller reports. Cleaner hydrogen trucks could also get a boost from more R&D funding. Electric vehicles: People who have been on the fence about purchasing an electric vehicle could be persuaded to buy one for two reasons, Joann reports: Health care: Democrats are seeking to expand health coverage for millions of Americans while reducing prescription drug prices, Axios\\' Caitlin Owens reports. Yes, but: The drug industry argues that forcing lower drug prices would curb innovation for new medicines for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\\'s. Child care and education: At their core, Biden’s programs seek to make it easier for women to stay in the workforce throughout life’s stages and struggles, Axios\\' Hans Nichols reports. Cities: The nation\\'s mayors are emphatic that the proposals — even if ultimately watered down — represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make cities more livable, modern and socially equitable, Axios\\' Jennifer Kingson reports. The bottom line: If the effort collapses under its own weight — or because Democrats have forgotten how to negotiate — the cost of the missed opportunities will shape America\\'s future, too.

Sign up for Axios Finish Line Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios The nation\\'s mayors are emphatic that this week\\'s hotly debated infrastructure legislation— even if ultimately watered down — represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make cities more livable, modern and socially equitable. Why it matters: While the money wouldn\\'t go directly to city coffers, it would fund everything from bridge and road repairs to the development of light rail and broadband — bringing massive numbers of jobs and daily-living improvements along the way. Illustration: Sarah Grillo/Axios An emerging Capitol Hill deal could give White House carbon-cutting goals a huge lift that looked all but impossible weeks ago. Why it matters: President Biden\\'s target under the Paris Agreement of cutting U.S. emissions 50% by 2030 could be within reach if Congress approves the new clean energy investments, analysts say — but it\\'s not clear that it would have the votes to pass.

Joe Manchin\\'s (D-W.Va.) declaration Sunday that he opposes President Biden\\'s signature climate and social policy legislation makes the administration\\'s task of meeting its climate goals far more difficult. Why it matters: The setback to slashing emissions comes as scientists say time is running out to avoid far worse impacts from global warming. Copyright Axios Media, 2024',\n",

Mayors see this as a pivotal moment to bolster city livability and equity through funding for public projects.
