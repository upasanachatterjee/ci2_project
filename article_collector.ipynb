Observers, primed to analyze battles of ideas, instead witness a chaotic spectacle where ideological positions serve merely as props. Bannon, labeled a populist and an America First advocate, has declared war on media figures and rival factions within Trump's administration, all while fueling gossip and drama reminiscent of reality TV. As political commentators grapple with this bizarre reality, it raises the question: are we merely fans of a political soap opera? With Bannon out, the narrative is set for more sensationalism ahead.\"}</div>"
